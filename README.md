## Design Patterns

### Singleton
- I used the Singleton for global access if I only want and expect ONE instance of said object (In this case world) This backlashed cause resetting and reinitialising it was 
  harder to do, I should have used a Service Locator instead and just overwrite the old instance with a new one (World)
  
  I.e. 
  World newWorld = Instantiate(somePrefab);
  Destroy(Service.Instance)
  Service.Set(newWorld)
  Would have added convenience

### Service Locator
- I used it for global access for the Player Manager and StateManager so I can reach it from anywher 
- These instances were persistent and never reset. Singleton would have been even beter cause later I realised I wanted the PlayerManager to be one persistent instance

### Object Pool
- Player has a bomb pool, bomb has a blast pool, World has an upgrade pool and a melt pool (Bomb that hits something melts)

### Decorator
- I combined ComponentPools to one pool that hands out a random powerup among the different pools. Therefore, I decorated a pool with randomness behaviour

### Component/Composition/Aggregation 
- The player has a Bomber, later on it can get decorated to make super bombs or other kinds of bombs since all we have to do is change the Bomber with another bomb handler
- Entity requires a death component. If a entity lives, it can die so one can not be without. It technically can, but in terms of this game it can't
  Similar to the car and engine analogy
- Additionally, I made my SubComponent that splits a Component into smaller Components

### Dependency Injection
- Most MonoBehaviours I use call GetComponent and get the contextual data/objects during Unity's way construction
- My SubComponents have a OnAwake method in which they can receive contextual components. As in, all the things they need

### Spatial Partioning (Sort of)
- I use the unity grid with a custom tile: A data grid. The data grid gets used to avoid physics collision detection
- Bombs, blasts, and so on. Movement uses physics collision detection

### State
- I made a State class. The state class is not utilising inheritance like in other State patterns I have seen, instead I use UnityEvents
- I use UnityEvents to allow StateChanges controlled through the Editor. If we want to transition from MenuState to GameplayState, I can change the SetActives through the
  UnityEvents. I can also use special initialisers and such to create the world, play an intro animation or whatever.
- The StateManager does not Update, instead it controls transitions  

### Activity Lifecycle
- My SubComponents implement a life cycle to give SubComponents a quick way to implement and guarantee usual lifecycle behaviour
- I have no idea what the real name is. It is compareable to Update (from Game Design Patterns) or (Gameplay Loop) or the Activity LifeCycle in Android Studio
